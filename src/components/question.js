Grade: C-\n---\nQuestion: You have been assigned the task of developing a new web-based application for a client. However, the client is unhappy with the progress of the project and has asked for a meeting to discuss the issues. Your task is to communicate the client\'s concerns and come up with a solution that meets their needs, while staying within the budget and timeline requirements. Specifically, you need to reduce the timeline by 25%, redesign the user interface, and stay within the initial budget. You must present a convincing solution to the client during the meeting to make them feel that their concerns have been taken into consideration. \n\nAnswer: I understand that the client is unhappy with progress on the project and would like to discuss it.
